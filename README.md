## Bug & Issues

[back](#index)

1. Media Query Issue
   When switching from full screen to mobile screen, navigation links are not displayed when clicking the hamburger button. This functionality worked on static pages but stopped working after breaking down into smaller components.

2. Advanced Search Page CSS Error
   There are two missing styles. This feature was working on single static pages but is not functioning properly after splitting into small components.
